3. What data structure do you expect to have the best (fastest) performance?
Hash map. Although rehashing is costly, the time complexity for get() to retrieve the MyList of
anagrams is O(1). This beats out the BST and AVL Tree time complexities, O(n) and O(lg n)
respectively.

4. Which one do you expect to be the slowest?
Binary Search Tree. Especially considering that the words in the words.txt file seem to
be lexicographically sorted, this means the tree will be severely lopsided and the get()
method will have O(n) time complexity.

5. Do the results of timing your programâ€™s execution match your expectations?
Yes they do! Hashmap would be the fastest, since getting the MyList of anagrams is simply
indexing an array (O(1)). AVL Tree would be the second fastest, since the maximum depth of
the tree is lg(n) & thus to get the MyList runs in O(lg n) time. BST would be the slowest
due to the tree being very lopsided and the get() method running in linear time. I had thought
that the outcome could be different due to the costliness of rehashing the hash map and
rebalancing the AVL tree, but it seems that the get() method is what influences the execution
time the most since there are so many dictionary entries.
